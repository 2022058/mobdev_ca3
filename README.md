# Execution of this project

This project was based on the creation of an Ionic application to consume the Breaking Bad API https://breakingbadapi.com and demonstrate the content in four categories: characters, episodes, quotes and death count.

# Step by step to create the application:

- first I created the repository on Github
- downloaded the repository on my Desktop
- Imported repository files to VSCode
- It was necessary to download some extensions in VSCode like Angular, Explore-cantainer and Node-modules to proceed with the project.
- I synchronized the VSCode with GitHub to carry out the committees automatically.

# The following steps were taken to complete the application:

GItPoded scripts were used to configure the environment and automatically pre-install Ionic and Angular CLI;

App Layout Setup and Table Creation: Change tables created in the GitHub repository for characters, episodes, quotes, and kill counts, then create new sub-tables with Back-Navigation functionality for the Character details and Episode details sub-tables ;

API data was consumed: use Observables, ngFor and ngIf logic provided by Angular;

The icons for the design of the tables were used from the Ionic/Ionicons website.

# Browser

The application is in the Browser: http://localhost:4200
