Module Titles: Mobile Development, Cloud-based Web Applications
Assignment Title: Containerised API-based Mobile App

Assessment Task: Mobile Development

You are required to build an Ionic application that can consume Breaking Bad API
https://breakingbadapi.com and display the data in 4 tabs – Characters, Episodes, Quotes, Death
Count. Complete the following steps in order to produce a working Breaking Bad Fandom application:

1.	Set up the environment: utilise GitPod scripting to automatically pre-install Ionic and Angular CLI, install modules and plugins, generate the required pages and service(s).

2.	Set up the core app aspects: routing, tabs and introduce a Back-Navigation functionality for all the required tab subpages (Characters and Episodes).

3.	Consume API data: use Observables, ngFor and ngIf logic provided by Angular.

4.	Improve the design: change the default Ionic UI, theming & CSS variables and showcase the ability to use appropriate Ionic Icons for the tabs.

5.	Possess a coherent commit history on GitHub (at least 8 valid and logical commits) and have your final submission code present in your Git repository. Your GitHub repo containing the full Ionic project must be called – mobdev_ca3. Also reference here any solution or code from someone else that you used in your CA by providing links to the original materials either in Dockerfile comments or inside README.md file.

6.	Record a voiced-over video screencast in MP4 format (10 minutes max) showing how your app works and how exactly you decided to go about making it.
